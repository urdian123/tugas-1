# Introduction
The quest to understand human learning has, in the past four decades,
undergone dramatic change. Once a matter for philosophical argument, the
workings of the mind and the brain are now subject to powerful research
tools. From that research, a science of learning is emerging.

In 1995, the U.S. Department of Educationâ€™s Office of Educational Research
and Improvement (OERI) requested that the National Research Council (NRC)
synthesize research on the science of learning. The resulting report, How
People Learn, reviews research literature on human learning and suggests
important implications for the design of curricula, instruction, assessments,
and learning environments (National Research Council, 1999a). It suggests
further that many existing school practices are inconsistent with what is
known about effective learning.

The purpose of this report is to ask how the insights from the research
reviewed in How People Learn can be incorporated into classroom practice
and to suggest a research and development agenda that would inform and
stimulate the required change. The implications of the report for educational practice and its determinants are fundamental and far-reaching. Still,
there are many influences on classroom practice that are unrelated to the
research reviewed in How People Learn. We know, for example, that nutrition affects ability to learn. The adequacy and safety of the school can have
direct influences on learning. An alternative salary structure for the teaching
profession can affect the ability of schools to attract and keep qualified
teachers, which in turn influences learning. We exclude these many issues
here, not as a judgment regarding their significance, but because they fall
outside the charge of the committee. Our focus is on the issues for which
learning research gives guidance
